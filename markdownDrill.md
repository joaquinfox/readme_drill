This information comes from a really good [tutorial](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fa%2Faa%2FPapageitaucher_Fratercula_arctica.jpg%2F1200px-Papageitaucher_Fratercula_arctica.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

This is **bold**
This is _italic_
This is *also* italic

This is a parapgraph.

This is a second paragraph.

This is a *third* paragraph.

This would normally appear as one long,\
rambling endless and runon and repetive sentence,\
but thanks to the judicious use of line breaks\
it is now and forever more, from this point forward and so on ...

# Heading 1 #
## Heading 2 ##
### Headeing 3 ###

#### Blockquotes ###


This is a regular paragraph without blockquotes

>This is a paragraph with blockquotes

Say for example I wanted to quote this guy
>I like pickles

Because he has so much to say

For a blockquote spanning multiple lines
>You can do something like this, 
where you just insert a bunch of \> and
>

>include one for blank lines

You can <www.somelink.com> to stuff with \<>

For inline links use a combination of [] and () like this

### Images
You insert images using ![]() as in

![puffins](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fa%2Faa%2FPapageitaucher_Fratercula_arctica.jpg%2F1200px-Papageitaucher_Fratercula_arctica.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

The syntax for inserting an alt comment is [alt goes here]:imagelink "title goes here"

For example

![puffin][1]

[1]:https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fa%2Faa%2FPapageitaucher_Fratercula_arctica.jpg%2F1200px-Papageitaucher_Fratercula_arctica.jpg&f=1&nofb=1 "Cute Puffins"

### Code
Use indents or backticks like so

` for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
if(arr[i] !== 'Hanga Banga'){
return 'Banga Boom Boom'
}
}`

And also like this
```
function fooBurgers(){
let idx1=0, idx2=0, result=[];
while(idx1 < arr1.length && idx2 < arr2.length){
if(){}
}}
}


```
